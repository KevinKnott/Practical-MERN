Udemy-Full-Stack

I am taking on it myself to relearn all of my webdev from scratch as I have run into problems developing my Spotify App (Which is currently private)

In order to do this I am following a course on Udemy called: Udemy: [Node with React: Fullstack Web Development](https://cglearning.udemy.com/course/node-with-react-fullstack-web-development/learn/lecture/7593644#overview)

This will be a constantly updated REPO to follow my progress
